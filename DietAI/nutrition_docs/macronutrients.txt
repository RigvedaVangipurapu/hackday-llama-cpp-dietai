MACRONUTRIENTS GUIDE

Macronutrients are the three main nutrients that provide energy to the body: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Each plays a crucial role in maintaining health and supporting bodily functions.

CARBOHYDRATES
Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy. They are broken down into glucose, which fuels the brain, muscles, and other organs.
- Simple carbohydrates: Found in fruits, milk, and processed foods. Provide quick energy but can cause blood sugar spikes.
- Complex carbohydrates: Found in whole grains, legumes, and vegetables. Provide sustained energy and are rich in fiber.
- Recommended intake: 45-65% of total daily calories for most adults.
- 1 gram of carbohydrates = 4 calories

PROTEINS
Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues, producing enzymes and hormones, and supporting immune function.
- Complete proteins: Contain all essential amino acids. Found in animal products (meat, fish, eggs, dairy) and some plant sources (quinoa, soy).
- Incomplete proteins: Missing some essential amino acids. Found in most plant foods. Can be combined to form complete proteins.
- Recommended intake: 10-35% of total daily calories, or 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight for adults.
- 1 gram of protein = 4 calories

FATS
Fats are essential for hormone production, vitamin absorption, brain health, and providing long-term energy storage.
- Saturated fats: Found in animal products and some tropical oils. Should be limited to less than 10% of total calories.
- Unsaturated fats: Found in nuts, seeds, avocados, and fish. Include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (omega-3 and omega-6).
- Trans fats: Should be avoided as much as possible. Found in processed foods.
- Recommended intake: 20-35% of total daily calories.
- 1 gram of fat = 9 calories

MACRO BALANCING
A balanced diet typically includes a mix of all three macronutrients. The ideal ratio depends on individual goals:
- Weight loss: May benefit from higher protein (25-30%), moderate carbs (30-40%), moderate fats (25-35%).
- Muscle building: Higher protein (25-35%), higher carbs (40-50%), moderate fats (20-30%).
- General health: Balanced approach with 40-50% carbs, 20-30% protein, 25-35% fats.
