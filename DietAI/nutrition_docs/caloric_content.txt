CALORIC CONTENT GUIDE

Understanding caloric content is essential for managing weight and meeting nutritional goals. Calories measure the energy provided by food and beverages.

DAILY CALORIE NEEDS
Calorie requirements vary based on age, gender, activity level, and metabolic rate:
- Sedentary women: 1,800-2,000 calories per day
- Active women: 2,000-2,400 calories per day
- Sedentary men: 2,200-2,400 calories per day
- Active men: 2,400-3,000 calories per day

CALORIE DENSITY
Different foods provide different amounts of calories per gram:
- High calorie density: Nuts, oils, butter, cheese, processed foods
- Medium calorie density: Whole grains, lean meats, legumes
- Low calorie density: Vegetables, fruits, broth-based soups

COMMON FOOD CALORIE RANGES (per 100g)
- Vegetables: 20-50 calories (leafy greens, cucumbers, tomatoes)
- Fruits: 40-80 calories (berries, apples, oranges)
- Whole grains: 300-350 calories (brown rice, quinoa, oats)
- Lean proteins: 100-200 calories (chicken breast, fish, tofu)
- Nuts and seeds: 500-600 calories (almonds, walnuts, chia seeds)
- Oils: 900 calories (olive oil, coconut oil)

MEAL PLANNING BY CALORIES
- Breakfast: 300-500 calories
- Lunch: 400-600 calories
- Dinner: 500-700 calories
- Snacks: 100-200 calories each

WEIGHT MANAGEMENT
- To lose weight: Create a calorie deficit of 500-750 calories per day (aim for 1-2 lbs per week loss)
- To maintain weight: Match calorie intake to calorie expenditure
- To gain weight: Create a calorie surplus of 300-500 calories per day

QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
While calories matter, the quality of food is equally important. 200 calories from vegetables provides more nutrients and satiety than 200 calories from processed snacks.
